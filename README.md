# Test_Employees_Info_MVVM
Implementation MVVM with database. It works offline.

This is second version of the Test tasks I did. The aim was to implement an employees list, which contains cards 
with a names, surnames, and specializations. We got data from JSON on the transmitted link. Also, we use database 
in this case which allows us to work offline.
